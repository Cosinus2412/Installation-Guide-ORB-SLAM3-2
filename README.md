# Installation-Guide-ORB-SLAM3-2
While installing ORB-Slam3, I was confronted with multiple problems and solving them took me quite some time. Therefore, I decided to create this short repository, which focuses on how to install ORB-SLAM3/2 and provide you with solutions to fix occurring bugs quickly and easily. I hope it helps you to save some time! :)

## My set up/ used versions

• Ubuntu 20.04 

• Raspberry pi 4

• Cmake compiler: 3.23.3

• Python version: 2.7.18

• Gcc: 9.4.0

Note: The whole guide is tested on the set up/ versions above. I would recommend you to use the same set up / versions, otherwise the guide might not help you. You certainly don't need to run it on a Raspberry pi- I just wanted to mention that I used one!

## Further work 

Currently, I am working on running ORB-SLAM3 with a specific sensor. I will probably add some results and code to this repo when I am finished with the project!

### Note

If you encounter other/new errors using the same set up/ versions as above please free to report it in the issues!
Links in the refrence parts will be fixed soon...
